# Python Docker Boilerplate

This repository contains a simple boilerplate code and configuration to help you quickly set up a Python project to run within a Docker container. Docker allows you to create isolated environments for your Python applications, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across different systems.

## Prerequisites

Before using this boilerplate, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Python project within a Docker container:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-docker-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-docker-boilerplate
   ```

3. Place your Python application code or scripts in the `app` directory. You can modify the `Dockerfile` to specify the Python version or add any additional dependencies required for your application.

4. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t python-docker-app .
   ```

   This will create a Docker image named `python-docker-app`.

5. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it python-docker-app
   ```

   Your Python application will now run within the Docker container.

## Docker Compose

If you have a more complex setup or need to run multiple containers, you can use Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository is pre-configured to run the Python container.

1. Make sure you are in the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start the Python container as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Notes

- The `app` directory is mounted as a volume in the Docker container. This allows you to make changes to your code without rebuilding the image.

- The example code in the `app` directory is a simple "Hello, World!" script. Replace it with your Python code.

- Customize the Dockerfile and `requirements.txt` file to install any additional dependencies your project requires.
